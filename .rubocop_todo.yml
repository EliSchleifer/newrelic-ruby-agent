# The point is for the user to remove these configuration records
# one by one as the offenses are removed from the code base.
# Note that changes in the inspected code, or installation of new
# versions of RuboCop, may require this file to be generated again.

# trunk manages the ignoring of pre-existing issues. the rubocop todo
# file is therefore not needed with this setup.

# Now the tech debt of the ruby issues is no longer hidden
